## Overview

Enterprise data management often involves cleaning, normalizing, and identifying inconsistencies in data from various sources. The DataProcessor tool addresses this need with a streamlined and efficient approach. This tool, implemented in Python, leverages powerful libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, and scikit-learn to load, clean, normalize, analyze, and export your enterprise data. Its ability to process different data types (JSON, CSV, XML) makes it a versatile asset in any data pipeline. The use of basic machine learning techniques, such as K-Means clustering, further enhances its ability to identify and handle inconsistencies in your data.

## Features

- **Load Data** :open_file_folder:  
The `load_data()` method allows you to import your enterprise data from a file. It can handle a variety of file types including JSON, CSV, and XML. The imported data is stored in a Pandas DataFrame, which offers a plethora of functionalities for subsequent data manipulation and analysis.

- **Clean Data** :bathtub:  
The `clean_data()` method cleans your data by handling missing values and converting categorical data. It uses the `SimpleImputer` from scikit-learn to fill missing values, and the `LabelEncoder` to transform non-numerical labels to numerical labels.

- **Normalize Data** :chart_with_upwards_trend:  
The `normalize_data()` method normalizes your data, ensuring that all features have the same scale. This is especially important when using machine learning algorithms that are sensitive to feature scaling. The method uses the `StandardScaler` from scikit-learn for this purpose.

- **Identify Inconsistencies** :mag:  
The `identify_inconsistencies()` method applies a K-Means clustering algorithm to your data to identify possible inconsistencies. K-Means clustering is a basic machine learning technique that can reveal patterns and anomalies in your data, which could indicate inconsistencies.

- **Export Data** :floppy_disk:   
The `export_data()` method allows you to export your cleaned and normalized data to a file. Like the `load_data()` method, it supports various file types including JSON, CSV, and XML. This makes it easy to integrate this tool into your existing data pipeline.

Overall, the DataProcessor tool is an all-in-one solution for managing your enterprise data, providing a seamless and efficient way to prepare your data for further analysis or machine learning applications.

# Installation Instructions for DataProcessor Project

This document provides detailed installation instructions for the DataProcessor project. The DataProcessor is a tool designed to clean and normalize enterprise data from various sources. It uses basic machine learning techniques to identify inconsistencies in the data.

## 1. Prerequisites

Before installing the DataProcessor, you need to ensure your system has the following software and libraries installed:

- Python 3.7 or later
- pandas
- numpy
- scikit-learn
- Python typing
- json
- csv
- xml

You can check if Python is installed on your system by running the following command in the terminal:

```sh
python --version
```

If Python isn't installed, you can download it from the [official Python website](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

To install the required Python libraries, you can use pip, which is a package manager for Python. Run the following commands in your terminal:

```sh
pip install pandas
pip install numpy
pip install -U scikit-learn
pip install typing
```

## 2. Installation Process

Follow these steps to install the DataProcessor project:

1. Clone the repository from GitHub:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/[username]/DataProcessor.git
```

Replace `[username]` with the username of the repository owner.

2. Navigate to the cloned repository:

```sh
cd DataProcessor
```

## 3. Verification Steps

To verify that the installation was successful:

1. Import the DataProcessor in a Python shell:

```python
from DataProcessor import DataProcessor
```

If you don't get any error messages, the installation was successful.

2. You can also run a sample script to verify the installation:

Create a new Python file, `test.py`, in the same directory as the DataProcessor project. Then, add the following code:

```python
from DataProcessor import DataProcessor

processor = DataProcessor()
print(processor)
```

Run `test.py`:

```sh
python test.py
```

If you see a printout of the `DataProcessor` object with no errors, the installation has been successful.

## 4. Post-Installation Configuration

After the installation, you may need to configure the DataProcessor for your specific use case. This includes setting up the paths for data loading and exporting, and fine-tuning the machine learning models for identifying data inconsistencies.

Remember to always handle data with care and ensure it is properly secured and managed to maintain its integrity and confidentiality.

# DataProcessor Class - Usage Guide

The `DataProcessor` class is a powerful tool designed to clean, normalize, and identify inconsistencies in enterprise data from various sources. This guide will walk you through the basic and advanced usage scenarios, common use cases, and expected output examples.

## 1. Basic Usage

To use the `DataProcessor` class, You first need to instantiate it:

```python
dp = DataProcessor()
```

### 1.1 Loading Data

You can load data into the `DataProcessor` instance using the `load_data` function. This function accepts two parameters: `file_path` and `file_type`. The `file_path` parameter requires the path to the data file (as a string), and the `file_type` parameter requires the type of the data file (also as a string).

Here is an example of loading a CSV file:

```python
dp.load_data('/path/to/data.csv', 'csv')
```

### 1.2 Cleaning Data

Once the data is loaded, you can clean it using the `clean_data` function. This function does not require any parameters.

```python
dp.clean_data()
```

### 1.3 Normalizing Data

After cleaning the data, you can normalize it using the `normalize_data` function. Like the `clean_data` function, this function does not require any parameters.

```python
dp.normalize_data()
```

### 1.4 Identifying Inconsistencies

To identify inconsistencies in your data, use the `identify_inconsistencies` function. This function does not require any parameters.

```python
dp.identify_inconsistencies()
```

### 1.5 Exporting Data

Finally, you can export your processed data using the `export_data` function. This function requires the same parameters as `load_data`: `file_path` and `file_type`.

```python
dp.export_data('/path/to/export.csv', 'csv')
```

## 2. Common Use Cases

The `DataProcessor` class is highly versatile and can handle a range of use cases. Here are a few examples:

- **Data Cleaning**: If your data contains NA values, outliers or inconsistencies, the `DataProcessor` can handle these issues with `clean_data` and `identify_inconsistencies` methods.
- **Data Normalization**: If you are preparing your data for a machine learning model, you can use the `normalize_data` function to standardize your numerical values.

## 3. Command-Line Arguments

This library does not directly support command-line operations. It is intended to be used within Python scripts or notebooks.

## 4. Expected Output Examples

The `DataProcessor` class operates on the data in-place. That means the data stored in `dp.data` will be modified directly by the operations. For example:

```python
dp = DataProcessor()
dp.load_data('/path/to/data.csv', 'csv')
print(dp.data.head())
```

This will print the first five rows of the loaded data.

After cleaning, normalizing and identifying inconsistencies, you can check the resultant data:

```python
dp.clean_data()
dp.normalize_data()
dp.identify_inconsistencies()
print(dp.data.head())
```

This will print the first five rows of the processed data.

## 5. Advanced Usage Scenarios

For more advanced usage, you can combine operations or integrate the `DataProcessor` class into larger data processing pipelines.

For example, you can load, process, and export the data in a single sequence:

```python
dp = DataProcessor()
dp.load_data('/path/to/data.csv', 'csv')
dp.clean_data()
dp.normalize_data()
dp.identify_inconsistencies()
dp.export_data('/path/to/export.csv', 'csv')
```

This sequence will load the data, clean it, normalize it, identify inconsistencies, and then export the processed data to a new file.
